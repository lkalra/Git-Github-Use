GitHub-----------

to conect your git to github - git remote add origin "url(github repo)" 
git remote -v - will show url attached to the folder 
git push origin master - to push file in repo

you cannot add anything to someone else repo 
so on top right use fork and copy repo to your github 

thn copy your code link from github

to clone it on your system - git clone url-will download that folder
cat file name - everything in file 


git remote add upstream(original url from where you forked it) url
git remote -v will show your url as origin and original url as upstream 

never comit on main branch 
git branch kalra
git checkout kunal 
branch will be changed to kalra now 


now to checkout if your fork copy is behind the original data 
git checkout main
git fetch --al --prune
git reset --hard upstream/main
git log both will have same comits

to push the same to your fork copy
git push origin main

git pull upstream main - internally does the git fetch thing only - local folder gets sync with the original data
git push origin main - pushes lcal data to your fork copy

merge all comits copy id of the comit (jiske upr se sb merge krne hai) 
git log
git rebase -i url

choose the comits you want to squash and change pick to s
